# Lab 03

## The PRISM curious
- Make the stochastic Readers & Writers Petri Net seen in lesson work: perform experiments to investigate the probability that something good happens within a bound
- Play with PRISM configuration to inspect steady-state proabilities of reading and writing (may need to play with options anche choose “linear equations method”)

  #### See report on chapter 2.2

## The PRISM vs Scala investigator
- Take the communication channel example, and perform comparison of results between PRISM and our Scala approach
- Write Scala support for performing additional experiments and comparisons (e.g., G formulas, steady-state computations)

  [Additional experiments support](https://github.com/federicomazzini3/pervasive-computing-part2-lab/blob/03-solutions/src/main/scala/pc/modelling/CTMCAnalysis.scala)
